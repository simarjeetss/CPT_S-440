# Chess Engine Development

## Goal
Develop a chess engine using two different methodologies:

1. **Classic Approach** - Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning (Similar to Stockfish)
2. **Reinforcement Learning** - Training using Deep Learning and Self-Play (Similar to AlphaZero)

## Chess Board Setup
To manage the chessboard, we will use the `python-chess` library. This library provides functionalities for:

- Board representation
- Move generation and validation
- Game state tracking
- PGN/FEN parsing
